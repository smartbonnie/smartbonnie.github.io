I just had my first encounter with someone truly affected by what's happening in America with ICE. I met this person in a game, and I won't say more to protect her.

She was worried about a car driving through her neighborhood. Our first thought was to call 911 and see if the police could do something about it.

When she mentioned that the police wouldn't do anything unless a report was filed at the station, I thought I was being funny and suggested, "Why don't you call ICE and say there are illegal immigrants around?"

Then it all came out. She revealed that she had family members who had been detained and deported by ICE, even though they weren't criminals.

Of course, I apologized, and later, I spoke with her privately. It's just the way things are now; you have to be careful about what you say to whom. Before you know it, you might be facing an actual victim.

I was shocked. It felt like making a Gestapo joke to Anne Frank. I must say it still deeply affects me.

It seems so far away from us. Far from my bed. But on the internet, you realize it's actually very close. And what's worse is that it's getting closer.

If you look at my website under organizations, you'll see three contributions about the Heritage Foundation. There, you can read about how they plan to export their approach to Europe as well.

Besides supporting the victims, we need to be aware that it could happen here too. We have a history that should make us stronger against this threat. But money is power, and that's what we need to be careful about.
